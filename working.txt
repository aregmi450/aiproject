To download the dataset go through the link- 
https://www.kaggle.com/andradaolteanu/gtzan-dataset-music-genre-classification

Only copy the " genres_original " folder inside the Data section after unzipping the file. 
Remove the "jazz.00054.wav " file from the jazz folder, as the file that we downloaded from the website is corrupted, it has some hexadecimal values that the system cannot interpret and extract the features from. 

The other items(with the extension .mf) are not needed for our project so you can discard them. Only have the 10 folders which are named after the different genres inside the main folder genres_original. 

you need to install all the dependencies in the requirements.txt file 
must have ananconda navigator and Python installed into your device.
